<p>
Sterling Galleon Corporation (hereby referred to as "Company," "We," "Us," "Our") understands the value of privacy and we understand that You (referred hereto as "User", "Users", "Client", "They", "Customer", "Customers") want to keep your personal information private.
</p>
<p>
This Privacy Policy will delineate information we collect from our website users, as well as how we collect and use those information. This also explains the practices we have taken to secure the information we have gathered as well as the user’s options regarding the collection, use, or disclosure (whenever required) of certain information. However, the use of Galleon.ph (the "Website") affirms that the customer accept the rules and guidelines set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>The use of this site affirms that the user is at least 18 years old. Data obtained from users below 18 years of age will be promptly deleted.</p>
<p>Please be reminded that this Privacy Policy applies primarily, and solely, to the Website alone. Any offline collection of personal information is not bound by these guidelines. Furthermore, we are not liable for the privacy measures of any other websites other than Galleon.ph, whether the Website is linked to that particular site or that site links to Galleon.ph.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Data Collection</strong>
</p>
<p>Data we collect from users are used to enhance the experience of users, such that it allows users to create an account and purchase products through the Website. We gather and store specific information that users provided in the Website. The types of information that we collect may include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>first and last name</li>
  <li>primary and alternate email address</li>
  <li>birthday</li>
  <li>gender</li>
  <li>billing address which includes zip codes</li>
  <li>any other information about the User when the User signs up to our Services or website, and when the User uses the Services or website, as well as information related to how the User uses our services or website.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Registration using Mobile no.</b></p>
<p>Sterling Galleon Mercado (mercado.galleon.ph) enables users to register and connect to our website using their telephone number. We gather and store your mobile no. but not limited to user’s name and email address. This information is used in general to augment details on the Website’s user accounts in our servers. The Website reserves the right to use this information only for use within the Galleon.ph website.</p>
<strong>Online Payments</strong>
<p>We do not store nor can we access bank-related information like credit card numbers, security codes, and card expiration dates for any online payments made through our Website.</p>
<strong>Email</strong>
<p>We receive a confirmation every time a user opens an email from us. Details in the said confirmation will be used to help us improve our future emails and newsletters.</p>
<p>Certain information are collected and stored whenever a user interacts with our Website. We automatically gather and store data from our server logs from the user’s browser such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>IP address</li>
  <li>cookies or the click streaming data</li>
  <li>page/pages that the user requested</li>
  <li>item/items purchased</li>
</ul>
<p>Website usage data like the number or frequency of visitors of the Website may also be utilized collectively for statistical functions. These types of information is used primarily to detect which part of the Website or services functions best and to make further improvements to the Website as well as the Company’s services as deemed necessary.</p>
<p>We may provide collective information to our partners about how the users, as a whole, use the Website. Take note, however, that Sterling Galleon Corporation does not disclose any information to its partners that will identify the users individually.</p>
<strong>Cookies and Streaming</strong>
<p>Cookies are alphanumeric indicators that are used by our system to identify the kind of browser that customers are using and signal us when a page in our Website is accessed and by how many users. These identifiers are sent to the user’s computer hard drive to basically gather "clickstream" data among users. These clickstream data is solely used for the purpose of choosing the most appropriate content to numerous Website visitors. Thus it should be made clear that cookies are not used to gather Personal Information.</p>
<strong>Security and User’s Information</strong>
<p>User’s personal information is password-protected for security and privacy. Thus, it is the sole responsibility of the user to protect his or her password accordingly and to limit access to the computer’s browser by logging out every time he or she is done accessing the account.</p>
<strong>Security through Encryption</strong>
<p>Order forms from the Website require users to enter Personal Information and Bank Details such as billing address. All data is encrypted using the industry-standard Secure Socket Layers ("SSL") encryption to keep the information and online order secured. This measure is made possible by adding "s" to the URL address "http," which actually signifies that the customer is in a secured area where SSL is employed.</p>
<p>We take extra procedures in electronic data handling to protect User’s Information; however, the Company cannot give 100% guarantee for the security of the User Account Information. Unauthorized use, hardware and software failure as well as natural or man-made calamities may compromise this security at any time.</p>

<p>Users can opt to "Unsubscribe" from the emails and mails that we send by changing their preference in the Account Settings or by clicking the "Unsubscribe" link which can be found in the emails that we send. Note that if a customer wishes to unsubscribe from Galleon.ph’s mailing list and would not want to receive notices such as the Privacy Policy, these legal notices will still govern the use of Sterling Galleon Corporation Website and it will be the sole responsibility of the user to review the changes of such legal notices.</p>
<strong>Updates</strong>
